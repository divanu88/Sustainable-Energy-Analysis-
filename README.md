# Sustainable-Energy-Analysis-
Analyzed global renewable energy trends using open-source data from Our World in Data. Cleaned and transformed datasets with Python (Pandas), stored and queried using SQL (SQLite), and visualized insights on top-performing countries in renewable energy adoption. Exported summary datasets for Tableau dashboarding, showcasing data management, analysis, and sustainability reporting skills.

**Key Objectives**

Clean and prepare raw energy and emissions data using Python (Pandas).

Store and query the cleaned data using SQLite for reproducible SQL practice.

Analyze renewable energy share and identify the Top 5 countries by average renewable contribution.

Visualize time-series trends for those top countries using Matplotlib.

Export a Tableau-ready summary dataset for dashboard visualization.

**Workflow Summary**

Load Excel dataset (sustainable energy data.xlsx).

Clean missing or inconsistent data and standardize column names.

Store the cleaned dataset in a SQLite database (sustainable_energy.db).

Run simple SQL queries to check data quality.

Identify top performers in renewable energy share.

Plot year-over-year renewable energy share for top 5 countries.

Export clean data (tableau_energy_summary.csv) for Tableau dashboards.

**Insights**

Countries with strong hydro and solar capacity (e.g., Iceland, Norway, or Paraguay) show consistently high renewable shares.

Developing countries with biomass dependency also rank high but face energy access gaps.

Combining renewable share with GDP and COâ‚‚ metrics reveals diverse sustainability pathways.
